# Data-harvesting-Project
This project was born from the motivation of helping other youngsters that might be doubtful of which one can be their best option for partying in Madrid, and since there is a webpage (Fourvenues) that concentrates the sale of tickets of the majority of events and clubs in Madrid, we thought it was the best option for getting our data.

Thus our scraper will be on the page of Forvenues in which every day new events come up allowing people to buy tickets through their webpage. The web has a main page that displays all the options with different dates and times and once you enter into each event types of tickets come up, allowing the user to choose the entry that best suits their interests.
